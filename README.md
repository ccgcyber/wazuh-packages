Wazuh is an Open Source Host-based Intrusion Detection System that performs log analysis, file integrity monitoring, policy monitoring, rootkit detection, real-time alerting, active response, vulnerability detector, etc.

In this repository, you can find the necessary tools to build a Wazuh package for Debian based OS (.deb) and an RPM based OS package (.rpm).

## Tools needed to build the package

To build a Wazuh package you need to install the following tools:
  - `docker`: [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/) for RPM and [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/) for Debian.
  - `git`: `apt-get install git` for Debian based OS or `yum install git` for RPM based OS.

## Building RPM packages

To build an RPM package, you need to download this repository and use the `generate_wazuh_rpm.sh` script. This script will download the source code from the [wazuh/wazuh](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh) repository or the [wazuh/wazuh-api](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-api) (depending on which package do you want to build), select automatically the RPM spec file, build a Docker image with all the necessary tools to build the RPM package and run a Docker container from that image that will generate the `.src.rpm` and `.rpm` packages.

1. Download this repository and go to the rpm directory:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-packages && cd wazuh-packages/rpms
    ```

2. Execute the `generate_rpm_package.sh` script to build the package. There are multiple parameters to select which package is going to be built, its architecture, etc. Here you can see all the different parameters:
    ```shellsession
    #./generate_rpm_package.sh -h

    Usage: ./generate_wazuh_rpm.sh [OPTIONS]

        -b, --branch <branch>     [Required] Select Git branch [master]. By default: master.
        -t, --target              [Required] Target package to build: manager, api or agent.
        -a, --architecture        [Optional] Target architecture of the package. By default: x86_64
        -j, --jobs                [Optional] Change number of parallel jobs when compiling the manager or agent. By default: 2.
        -l, --legacy              [Optional] Build the package for CentOS 5.
        -r, --release             [Optional] Package release. By default: 1.
        -p, --path                [Optional] Installation path for the package. By default: /var.
        -d, --debug               [Optional] Build the binaries with debug symbols. By default: no.
        -h, --help                Show this help.
    ```
    * To build a wazuh-manager package for x86_64, revision 3821 and store it in `/tmp`:
        `# ./generate_rpm_package.sh -b v3.8.2 -d /tmp -t manager -a x86_64 -r 3821`.
    * To build a wazuh-agent package for i386 with `-j15`, revision 3 and store it in `/tmp`:
        `# ./generate_rpm_package.sh -b v3.8.2 -d /tmp -t agent -a x86_64 -j 15 -r 3`.
    * To build a wazuh-api package from branch 3.9 and store it in `/tmp`:
        `# ./generate_rpm_package.sh -b 3.9 -d /tmp -t api -a x86_64 -r 0`.
    * To build a wazuh-manager x86_64 package for `/opt/ossec` directory and store it in `/tmp`:
        `# ./generate_rpm_package.sh -b v3.8.2 -d /tmp -t manager -a x86_64 -r 0.1 -p /opt`.
3. When the execution finish, you can find your `.src.rpm` and the `.rpm` packages in specified folder.


## Building DEB packages

Building a .deb package is pretty similar to build a .rpm package. You need to download the repository and execute the `generate_debian_package.sh` script. This will create the docker image, choose the needed files to build the package and build it.

1. Download this repository and go to the debs directory:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-packages && cd wazuh-packages/debs
    ```

2. Execute the `generate_debian_package.sh` script to built the package. There are multiple parameters to select which package is going to be build, its architecture, etc. Here you can see all the different parameters:
      ```shellsession
      #./generate_debian_package.sh -h

      Usage: ./generate_debian_package.sh [OPTIONS]

          -b, --branch <branch>     [Required] Select Git branch or tag e.g.
          -s, --store <path>        [Required] Set the destination path of package.
          -t, --target <target>     [Required] Target package to build [manager/api/agent].
          -a, --architecture <arch> [Required] Target architecture of the package [amd64/i386].
          -r, --revision <rev>      [Required] Package revision that append to version e.g. x.x.x-rev
          -j, --jobs <number>       [Optional] Number of parallel jobs when compiling.
          -p, --path <path>         [Optional] Installation path for the package. By default: /var/ossec.
          -d, --debug               [Optional] Build the binaries with debug symbols. By default: no.
          -h, --help                Show this help.

      ```
    * To build a wazuh-manager package for amd64 (x86_64) and store it in `/tmp`:
        `# ./generate_debian_package.sh -b 3.9 -d /tmp -t manager -a amd64 -r 0`.
    * To build a wazuh-agent package in `/home/ec2-user` for i386 with release 2:
        `# ./generate_debian_package.sh -b v3.8.2 -d /home/ec2-user -t agent -a i386 -r 2`.
    * To build a wazuh-api package from branch 3.9 and store it in `/tmp`:
        `# ./generate_debian_package.sh -b 3.9 -d /tmp -t api -a amd64 -r 0`.
    * To build a wazuh-manager amd64 (x86_64) package for `/opt/ossec` directory and store it in `/tmp`:
        `# ./generate_debian_package.sh -b 3.9 -d /tmp -t manager -a amd64 -r 0 -p /opt/ossec`.
3. When the execution finish, you can find your `.deb` packages in specified folder.
